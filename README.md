This is about my app

My app is about a dog that needs to be taken care of,so it will have two pages when the first page will link to the second page.
The first is is a welcome page to the app where it has a button named "woof" and when the person clicks the button it will take them to the second page

The second page is where the person will be able to take care of the dog, there is a feed button , a clean button , and a play button.
